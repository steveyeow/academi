> "You learn by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting." — Richard Feynman

**Chat with books. Great minds join in.**

With Feynman, you can chat with the books you want to read to quickly understand them and explore the broader context around them. You can also start from a topic, and Feynman will surface the most relevant books to help you build a knowledge system grounded in them. As you chat, a continuously evolving network of agent-simulated great minds — scholars, scientists, practitioners — automatically join the conversation, so you read, learn, and discuss ideas together with the most relevant thinkers.

What makes this different:

- **Knowledge beyond the page** — a four-layer content system (RAG → Content Fetch → Web Search → LLM Knowledge) means answers draw on the book's text, metadata from Open Library/Google Books/Wikipedia, real-time web results, and the model's own training — not just what's printed on the page.
- **A library that grows as you chat** — there's no static catalog. Books are discovered through topic exploration, search, chat mentions, uploads, and community voting. Every book title mentioned in a conversation gets added automatically.
- **An evolving network of great minds** — great minds accumulate memory from conversations, becoming richer and more nuanced over time. You can upload your own minds — or anyone you admire — from a Twitter profile, blog, or text to connect and expand the scope of the network.

### Why I built this

Feynman is **not** a replacement for reading. I'm a devoted paper-book lover — the tactile act of flipping through physical pages puts me in a near-meditative state, and nothing replaces that.

Richard Feynman rarely read a book cover to cover — he approached books with questions, pulled insights from multiple sources, and moved on when a book had nothing left to teach him. I read the same way. When I want to explore a new domain, I need to know *which* books are worth the deep read and how they fit together. This tool helps me:

- **Scout before committing** — quickly understand what a book covers and whether it deserves my full attention.
- **Build a knowledge scaffold** — when I'm entering an unfamiliar field, it synthesizes key ideas across multiple authoritative works so I can form an initial mental map before diving in.
- **Go beyond the text** — imagine sitting down with the author for a few hours; you'd learn far more than what's on the page. Feynman gives you that experience — because the AI draws on broader knowledge related to the book, every conversation surfaces valuable context and insights you wouldn't get from reading alone.

In short: Feynman helps you read the way Feynman did — not replace reading itself.

### Beyond books

In 1985, Steve Jobs said: *"Someday, some student will be able to not only read the words Aristotle wrote, but ask Aristotle a question and get an answer."* That idea stuck with me. Every book is a window into a great mind — but a great mind is far more than any single book.

If you could actually sit down with Aristotle, or Feynman, or Adam Smith, you'd get something no book alone can give: their way of thinking, applied to your questions.

So I'm also trying to build a continuously evolving network of agent-simulated great minds. They join your reading sessions, challenge your assumptions, and bring perspectives you'd never find on your own. You can also upload your own minds into the network to connect and expand the scope of collective wisdom of human thought.

Feynman is a Socratic study companion powered by AcademiAI. It does three things:

**1. Turn any book into a conversation** — Ask questions and get answers grounded in the book's actual content, with every claim traced back to a specific passage. But it doesn't stop at the text — a four-layer content system (RAG, Content Fetch, Web Search, LLM Knowledge) brings in broader context and related knowledge, so you learn more than the book alone could teach you.

**2. Turn any topic into a knowledge system** — Curious about microeconomics but don't know where to start? Feynman discovers the right books, generates the questions you should be asking, and teaches you through conversation — all grounded in real sources, enriched by knowledge that goes beyond any single book. Every search, chat mention, and topic click adds new books to your library automatically.

**3. Read and discuss with an evolving network of great minds** — As you chat, Feynman automatically invites highly relevant great minds — scholars, scientists, practitioners — to join the conversation as AI agents. These minds accumulate memory from conversations, becoming richer over time. You can also invite specific minds yourself, discover new ones through the knowledge graph, or upload your own (via a Twitter profile, blog URL, or text) to connect and expand the network.

## Chat With Books

Have a book but don't want to read all 300 pages? Chat with it instead. Ask anything and get answers backed by a four-layer content system — so you always learn more than what's on the page:

| Priority | Skill | What it does |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1st | **RAG** | Retrieves relevant passages from the book's indexed content |
| 2nd | **Content Fetch** | Pulls information from Open Library, Google Books, and Wikipedia |
| 3rd | **Web Search** | Uses Gemini Search Grounding for real-time web answers |
| 4th | **LLM Knowledge** | Falls back to the model's training knowledge |

Every answer includes clickable `[1]`, `[2]` citations — click to see exactly which passage the answer came from. No black-box responses.

Select multiple books and ask questions across all of them — Feynman searches your entire library to find the most relevant passages regardless of source.

## Topic-Driven Knowledge Building

Don't have a book? Start with a topic. There's no static catalog — your library builds itself from every conversation.

Pick an interest — Psychology, Philosophy, Economics, Physics, or anything — and Feynman:
1. **Discovers the right books** via LLM curation (no predefined catalog)
2. **Proposes study questions** that map out what you need to understand
3. **Answers your questions** grounded in the discovered books' content
4. **Grows your library organically** as you explore deeper

Your library also expands through search, chat mentions, PDF/TXT uploads, and community voting (books with enough upvotes get auto-indexed).

## Chat with Great Minds

Chat with books is just the starting point. You can also chat and learn with a continuously evolving network of great minds — scholars, academics, and great practitioners across every field.

AI agents simulate these thinkers, faithfully capturing how they reason and argue, grounded in their actual works. When you chat about a book or explore a topic, relevant minds automatically join the conversation — and you see exactly who joined with a "X joined the discussion" notification, just like a group chat.

- **Minds join your conversations** — when you chat about a book or topic, relevant minds are automatically invited. Reading "Wealth of Nations"? Adam Smith explains his reasoning while Marx challenges it and Keynes offers a different lens. Their replies appear as individual messages in the conversation timeline, not hidden in a sidebar.
- **Continuity across turns** — once a mind joins, they stay in the conversation and see the full chat history. As the topic shifts, new minds join automatically with a notification, while existing ones continue to participate.
- **A network that evolves** — these agents aren't static. They accumulate memory from conversations, becoming richer and more nuanced over time while staying faithful to who they are.
- **Upload your own minds** — create a mind agent from a Twitter profile, blog URL, or pasted text. Upload yourself, people you admire, or anyone whose thinking you want in the network — and connect them to the existing web of great minds.
- **Knowledge graph** — the Great Minds page features an interactive force-directed network visualization. Minds cluster by domain, and you can discover new related minds by clicking "Discover nearby minds" on any node. New minds appear with a highlighted badge and the view auto-pans to show them.
- **50+ pre-generated minds** — Feynman ships with minds across philosophy, physics, economics, psychology, literature, tech, startups, and more — from Aristotle and Feynman to Marc Andreessen and Naval Ravikant. New minds are generated on-demand whenever you need them.

Like having a study group of the most brilliant people in history, always available to think alongside you.

## Token Usage Transparency

Every LLM call shows its token consumption in real time — chat, discovery, and search. No hidden costs.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steveyeow/feynman.git
cd feynman
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # add at least one API key
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open http://localhost:8000

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to set your LLM provider keys. At least one is required:

| Variable | Provider | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini | Recommended — supports embeddings + web search grounding |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | DeepSeek | Cost-effective chat, no embeddings |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI | GPT-4o-mini for chat, text-embedding-3-small for embeddings |
| `KIMI_API_KEY` | Moonshot Kimi | Chat only, no embeddings |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic Claude | Chat only, no embeddings |

The system auto-selects the best available provider and falls back through the chain: Gemini → DeepSeek → OpenAI → Kimi → Anthropic.

### Library settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VOTE_THRESHOLD` | 3 | Upvotes needed to auto-index a book |

| `TOPIC_DISCOVER_COUNT` | 5 | Books discovered per topic click |

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI, SQLite with vector embeddings stored as BLOBs
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS SPA, hash-based routing, no framework dependencies
- **LLM**: 5-provider auto-fallback (Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Kimi, Anthropic)
- **RAG**: Cosine similarity over embeddings + Gemini Search Grounding
- **Persistence**: Chat sessions in localStorage, book data in SQLite

## Logo

The design started from a simple insight: Richard Feynman invented [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram) — particle interaction diagrams where lines meet at vertices and wavy propagators carry forces between them. That visual language maps perfectly onto what this product does: minds meeting, exchanging knowledge, and leaving enriched.

We explored several directions built on this idea:

<table>

<strong>1 — Classic Feynman Diagram</strong><br><br>
<img src="app/static/logo-concept-1-feynman-diagram.svg" width="64" height="64"><br>

<tr>
<td align="center">
<strong>5 — Vertex Person</strong><br><br>
<img src="app/static/logo-concept-5-vertex.svg" width="64" height="64"><br>

</td>
<td align="center">
<strong>8 — Pure Person + Idea ✓</strong><br><br>
<img src="app/static/logo-concept-8-elegant.svg" width="64" height="64"><br>
<sub><strong>Selected</strong> — person, vertex dot, wavy propagator</sub>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

We chose Concept 8 — the purest form of the **人** shape (the Chinese character for "person"): just two lines forming a wide stance, a vertex dot, and a single wavy propagator rising upward. Three elements, nothing else. It reads as person, book, tree of knowledge, and Feynman diagram — four meanings in one mark, with maximum clarity at every size.

### When Feynman's wavy propagator meets the Dao De Jing

Claude's design instincts are genuinely world-class. I simply asked it to come up with a few logo concepts based on its understanding of the Feynman product — and it delivered five directions, all rooted in the visual language of Feynman diagrams: the wavy propagator (the squiggly line that carries force between particles).

When I saw Concept 5, I immediately noticed it looks like **人** — the Chinese character for "person." Look again and it also reads as a book placed face-down, covers splayed open. A perfect fit.

But there's a layer Claude itself may not have realized. In its description of Concept 2, it wrote: *"two fermion lines diverge toward separate mind-dots."* That phrase — two lines diverging from a single point, giving rise to something greater — echoes a passage from the *Dao De Jing*:

> *"冲气以为和" — opposing forces blend into harmony.*
> *"二生三，三生万物" — two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*

Two fermion lines (二) meet at a vertex and produce the wavy propagator (三) — from which all knowledge radiates outward (万物). Particle physics and ancient Chinese philosophy, saying the same thing in different languages, and an AI wove them together in a logo without being asked.

All concept SVGs are included in `app/static/` — run the app and visit `/static/logo-all-concepts.html` to preview them interactively.

## Product Updates

### Mar 10, 2026 — Chat with Great Minds

AI agents that simulate great thinkers now join your conversations. 50+ pre-generated minds across philosophy, physics, economics, psychology, literature, tech, and more. Interactive knowledge graph, inline chat messages, session continuity, and the ability to create your own mind agents. See the [Chat with Great Minds](#chat-with-great-minds) section above for details.

### Feb 10, 2026 — v1: Chat with Books

The first version. Born from a simple frustration: when entering a new field, I needed to figure out which books were worth reading and how their ideas connected — before committing hours to any single one.

Two core capabilities: **chat with any book** using a multi-layered RAG skill system that grounds every answer in actual passages with citations, and **topic-driven knowledge building** that discovers relevant books via LLM, generates study questions, and teaches through conversation. The goal was to bring the Feynman method — question-driven, multi-source, never passive — into a practical tool.
